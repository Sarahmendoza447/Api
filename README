My OpenStreetMap Explorer Project is a simple demonstration of how the OpenStreetMap APi can be used to create an interactive website. 

The website contains a search button where the user may search for a place. The map will then pin the location being searched. 

They users may also opt to use the "My Location" button to get their real-time location and pin it on the map.

Aside from this, the users may use the cursor to point on a  specific location and use the button "Add Marker" to add marker on  it, and the "Clear Markers" button to remove all markers on the map. 

How to use OpenStreetMap Explorer?
1. Input the desired location in the search box located below the header. It is beside the 'Search input' label.
2. Click the search button to control the location showed in the map. (Note: The user can navigate in the map to successfully place the marker on the desired location)
3. There are 3 buttons labeled as 'My Location', 'Add Marker', and 'Clear Markers'. It functions as the following:
    My Location Button: allows the user to get the current location and display it in the OpenStreetMap for more precise and accurate location.
    Add Marker Button: allows the user to mark the desired location in the map.
    Clear Markers Button: allows the user to remove the markers added in the map.
4. The '+' and '-' button at the top-left corner of the map allows the users to zoom in or out.
5. The users can now explore the changes made in the OpenStreetMap Explore.
